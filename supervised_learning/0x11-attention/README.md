Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.16) and tensorflow (version 1.15)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
All of your files must be executable
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should follow the pycodestyle style (version 2.4)
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
Unless otherwise stated, you cannot import any module except import tensorflow as tf
Update Tensorflow to 1.15
In order to complete the following tasks, you will need to update tensorflow to version 1.15, which will also update numpy to version 1.16

pip install --user tensorflow==1.15
