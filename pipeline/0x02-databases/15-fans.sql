-- script that ranks country origins of bands, ordered by the number of (non-unique) fans
-- 
-- - Import this table dump: metal_bands.sql.zip
-- - Column names must be: origin and nb_fans
-- - Your script can be executed on any database
-- Context: Calculate/compute something is always power intensiveâ€¦ better to distribute the load!
