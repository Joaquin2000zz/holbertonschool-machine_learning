    determines the probability of a markov chain being in a

    - P is a square 2D numpy.ndarray of shape (n, n)
      representing the transition matrix
    - P[i, j] is the probability of transitioning from state i to state j
    - n is the number of states in the markov chain
    - s is a numpy.ndarray of shape (1, n) representing
